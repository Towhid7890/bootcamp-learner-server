Thus, to be the best data scientist you can be, you must have a working understanding of the most relevant math.Getting started in data science is easy thanks to high-level libraries like Scikit-learn and Keras. But understanding the math behind the algorithms in these libraries opens an infinite number of possibilities up to you. From identifying modeling issues to inventing new and more powerful solutions, understanding the math behind it all can dramatically increase the impact you can make over the course of your career.Led by deep learning guru Dr. Jon Krohn, this course provides a firm grasp of the mathematics — namely linear algebra and calculus — that underlies machine learning algorithms and data science models"
